Excuse me. Do you mind? Everywhere else is full. Not at all.
 I'm Ron, by the way, Ron Weasley. 
I'm Harry. Harry Potter. 
True. I mean, do you really have the birth or what? 
Anything off the trolley, dear? No, thanks. I'm all set. 
We'll take the lot. Birdie bought every flavor. Beans. They mean every flavor. 
There's chocolate and peppermint. And there's also spinach liver and tripe.
 George swear he got a bogey flavored one month. 
These aren't real frogs, are they? It's just a spell. Besides the card you want.

Each pack got a famous. Which about 500 of myself. Watch it. It's rotten luck. I've only got one good jumping. 
And to begin with, I've got Dumbledore. I got about six of him. He's gone.

Well, you can't expect and draw around all day, can you?

This is scattered, by the way. Pathetic, isn't he? Suffered a little bit. 
Fred gave me a spell after turning yellow. Want to see? Yeah.
 Has anyone seen his home? A boy named Neville lost one.
 Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then. Sunshine. Daisies, butter, mellow. Turn. It stupid. But yellow.
 Are you sure that's a real spell? 
Well, it's not very good, is it? 
Of course. I've only tried a few simple ones myself, but they've all worked for me. Example. Oculus, repair. That's better, isn't it? Holy cricket.

You're Harry Potter. I'm mildly Granger. 
And you are, Ron. Pleasure.
 You two better change into robes. 
I expect we'll be arriving soon. 
You've got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know? Just bear. You.
